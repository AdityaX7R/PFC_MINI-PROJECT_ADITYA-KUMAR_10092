📌 Strong Number Checker

This project is a simple C program that checks whether a given number is a Strong Number or not.
A Strong Number is a number whose sum of the factorials of its individual digits is equal to the original number.

The program stores the original number, extracts each digit using the modulo operator (%), calculates the factorial of each digit using a loop, and adds all the factorial values. Finally, it compares the calculated sum with the original number and prints whether the number is Strong or Not Strong.

🔢 Example

Input: 145

Calculation: 1! + 4! + 5! = 145

Output: Strong Number
